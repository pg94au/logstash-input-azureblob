# Logstash Plugin

[![Travis Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-example.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-example)

This is a plugin for [Logstash](https://github.com/elastic/logstash) that retrieves logs that have been written to an Azure blob storage container by the [log4net.Azure](http://stemarie.github.io/log4net.Azure/) appender.  It was written out of personal need, and of course comes with no guarantees.  It works for me!  :-)

It is fully free and fully open source. The license is Apache 2.0, meaning you are pretty much free to use it however you want in whatever way.
